    Upload the spreadsheet with the runners that are currently attending <b>run monash</b>.<br/>
    This will set only the runners from the spreadsheet active, and give you a list of those who are not currently in the database.
    <ul>
    <li>You can add them <a href="{{ url_for('runner') }}" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
    <li>Or if any of them are just mis spellings, go to the page above, search for them and click on the Update icon to set them active.</li>
